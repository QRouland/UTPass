Hello Quentin, how are you ?? I am trying to reach you about the CBDF tool :) . I tried to make it work but something is not working :) I tried sending you an email to your personal one : quentin@qrouland.com. My number is still the same +1 613 600 8516 and I still use the same emails: sgjorceski@gmail.com and stojanchegjorcheski@cmail.carleton.ca .  I would really appreciate if we could me and receive a little guidance by your side for the tool :) Thanks.
